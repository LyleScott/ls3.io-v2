Description
===========

Timezones are identified by a 2-digit country code followed by unique identifier, which is in most
cases in a well-known city in that time zone. For example, Great Britain's timezone is identified as
`GB/London`. Country codes are defined in the `ISO 3166`_ International Standard for country codes.

List of Supported Timezones
===========================

Here is the list of timezones that our system accepts. Make sure that the timezone you are using is
included in this list. Note that each Timezone is _identified_ in our system by the `name` column
below.

Every timezone listed here is a valid timezone from the `IANA Time Zone Database`_ (also
known as the Olson Time Zone Database).  See the `Olson name` column for the name used in the
corresponding database entry.

.. note::
   We update our copy of this list manually to avoid conflicts, so we may not be using the
   most recent version of the global time zone data at any given time. In most parts of the world
   this is unlikely to affect you.
