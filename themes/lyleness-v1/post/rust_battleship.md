## Rust ... as a Newcomer

What a neat language, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is. It's a pretty low-level language that
reminds me of dipping down to [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) where
you need to be very specific on data types, references, and where all the free-form magic you get
with something like [Python](https://www.python.org/) does _not_ exist.

What you get with all the pain, though, is compile time safety, a reasonable expectation you'll be
safe a run-time, and performance that blows most other languages away. The footwork you have to
do with the typing system doesn't seem _that_ low-level, though! At frequent times, you'll break
out some features that will make you think you're in a high-level language. And it even has good
support for [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) techniques that
aid in cutting down alot of the verbosity in such a strict language.

## Learning Rust

My first suggestion when trying to learn a language is **write something**. Anything, really.
Sure, do some research on the language, read a few tutorials, but you need to actually write in the
language to get a feel for it.

I'd highly recommend [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). This language guide
is shepherded by [rust-lang.org](https://rust-lang.org) themselves, so it's usually thorough and
gets updated with the language.

For me, I wrote some stuff here and there when I was following allong with the book. I immediately
started thinking of something a bit more _complex_ to get a better feel for the language. I
figured, why not write a silly little game.

I picked [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_\(game\)).

## Battleship... in Rust

You can check out [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/LyleScott/rust-battleship) for the code and
some words about how to play it.
